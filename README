=== HTTPIdent/httpi ===
A protocol for providing identification/authentication of HTTP requests using GPG signing.
This interface allows you to authenticate a HTTP request with your private key to provide secure interfaces to
HTTP management interfaces and such without having to use password auth.

The protocol runs with 2 HTTP headers, X-ident-token and X-ident-signature. 
X-ident-token is a token provided by the server to allow you to attempt authentication on a specific URL.
Usually, the interface provided by the ident script (e.g. https://x/y.ident) should reference a base script with 
the same name (https://x/y) -`.ident', but this is not required. Ident tokens can expire through timeout, misuse
or auth. They are single use random hashes and are tied to a specific request URL and IP address.
X-ident-signature is the signature of the serialised HTTP request (without the X-ident-signature header added) in 
sorted JSON with whitespaces. The signature is checked after the validity of the token is, if either fails, the token is
considered expired.
Successful auths are logged by the server. Failed auths are not logged but have a bit set to show why they failed; unless verbose access logging is enabled in the server config.

Each request requires a new token, so this is not viable for full web interfaces, nor is it intended for this use.

=== Requirements: Client ===
GnuPG
Python 3
python urllib

=== Usage: Client ===
Call the script with the request URL:
 - python httpireq.py httpi://example.com/service?arg1=value
Or with a specified key:
 - python httpireq.py key_id_here httpi://example.com/service

httpi://x/y is the same as https://x/y.ident

Query strings must be passed to the ident page as well. 
If you want to request /page?data=asdf. You must request a token from 
/page.ident?data=asdf as well.


=== Requirements: Server ===
GnuPG
MariaDB
PHP 7
Python 3

Note for servers:
HTTPIdent looks for files that end in `.ident'. Make sure PHP is running on those.

=== Usage: Server ===
Create a user for HTTPI in MariaDB and create a database for her with full privileges. Set these details in the 
config file `conf.inc'.

Run the maintain script `setupdb.php' from the command line (make sure `../httpi.inc' resolves).

Set up GPG for the user php-fpm is running on (home can be configured in conf.inc) and import the keys you wish to allow.

Set your server to serve `www', make sure *.ident is passed to PHP.

(TODO: Add script for adding page templates)

--- Adding httpi pages ---

To add an ident page it must be accessable as `.*\.ident$'. Configure your 
server to send .ident pages to PHP. A .ident page shadows the actual page, 
which is usually named the same, but doesn't have to be. (The client 
script will typically show a warning when such a redirect occurs.)
To set up an ident page, simply call `httpi_ident_page(string)' with the page 
you wish to shadow (e.g. httpi_ident_pave("/example")). Then, to set up
an authed page, call `httpi_auth_page()'. httpi_auth_page() returns
the GPG signature details if it succeeds, and dies with error 403 and a message
if it does not.
